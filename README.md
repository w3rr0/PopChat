# PopChat

A lightweight desktop widget that provides instant access to local language models via Ollama engine. 

Designed to be unobtrusive and efficient, PopChat acts as a quick overlay for your AI interactions without cluttering your workspace. It brings the power of local LLMs to your fingertips with a single keystroke.

## Features

* **Instant Access:** Toggle the chat window globally with a shortcut (default: `Ctrl+Shift+K`).
* **Minimalist Design:** A compact, floating UI that stays out of your way.
* **Local & Private:** Fully powered by your local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance.
* **Configurable:** Easily switch between models (e.g., Llama3, Mistral) via the settings menu).
